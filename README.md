### 👋 Hi there! I'm DNin01.

I like:
- 🎮 Playing games
- 🎨 Creating games, helpful tools, music and more
- 🤝 Helping people out

My first serious programming began in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). I also know a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I joined GitHub because I wanted to contribute to other projects I care about.

What I do as a developer:
- ✨ I think a lot about user experience. I try to find ways to make software easier to use and bring attention to small things that make a big difference.

I also like imagining how my own operating system, computers, devices and apps would work and I want to bring them into the world someday.
