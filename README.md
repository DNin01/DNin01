Hi! I'm DNin01.

I love to game, write code, create music, and come up with ideas.

I haven't done much of that text-based programming at all yet, but I like coding through Scratch, Shortcuts, and more.

I'm here on GitHub because I wanted to contribute to other open-source projects I love! But I've also been imagining brands in my head for a long time, and maybe someday I'll work my way up to being a real developer or making a team.
