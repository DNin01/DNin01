Hi there! I'm DNin01.

I like gaming, coding, creating music, and coming up with ideas.

I like focusing on the small things, sharing my ideas, and trying to make software as great as possible. You'll see a lot of that coming from me.

I have yet to learn the main text-based programming languages like JavaScript and Python, but I know [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and I like anything that's "low-code", they can get me attached.

I'm on GitHub mainly to contribute to other open-source projects I love, but, imagining product brands and ideas for big things like operating systems, I think I might start a team at some point.
