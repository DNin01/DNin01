### 👋 Hi there! I'm DNin01.

I like:
- 🎮 Playing games
- 🎨 Creating games, helpful tools, music and more
- 🤝 Helping out

My first serious programming began in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). I also know a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I joined GitHub because I wanted to contribute to other projects I care about.

I think a lot about user experience and try to find ways to make software easier to use.

I also like imagining how my own operating system, computers, devices and apps would work and I want to bring them into the world someday.
