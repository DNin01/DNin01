### 👋 Hi! I'm DNin01.

#### I like:
- 🎮 Playing games
- 🎨 Being creative
- 🤝 Helping out

#### How did you get into coding?
My first serious programming began in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Despite being simplified, it's a pretty powerful tool and I enjoyed creating programs in it, and still use it today.

Now, I write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### What are you great at?
- ✨ I think a lot about user experience. Whenever I make software or collaborate, I try to find ways to make things as easy to use as possible and look for small things that make a big difference.

#### What do you want to do in the future?
I dream of starting a company that makes software and tech products, and I'm already imagining what it could be like!
