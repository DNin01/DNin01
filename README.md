Hi! I'm DNin01.

I'm into gaming and coding. I haven't done much text-based programming at all yet, but I like other kinds of coding and I've used Scratch, Shortcuts, and more.

I'm here on GitHub because I wanted to contribute to other open-source projects I love! But I've also been imagining brands in my head for a long time, and maybe someday I'll work my way up to being a real developer.
