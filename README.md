Hi, GitHub explorer! I'm DNin01.

I love to game, code, create music, and come up with ideas.

I have yet to learn HTML, CSS, JS, Git, and text-based programming in general. However, I do know how to write JSON. I also like coding Scratch projects, (Siri) Shortcuts, and more. Anything that's "low-code" can get me attached.

I'm here on GitHub because I wanted to contribute to other open-source projects I love! But I've also been imagining brands in my head for a long time, so maybe someday I'll work my way up to being a real developer or making a team.
